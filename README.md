# Laundry Time Tracker

Laundry Time Tracker is a web application designed to help a laundry company track the working hours of its stores located in different locations. The application was developed using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design were created by me using Figma.
